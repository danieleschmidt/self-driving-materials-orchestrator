# CI/CD Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the recommended GitHub Actions workflows for the self-driving-materials-orchestrator project. These workflows implement continuous integration, security scanning, and automated testing.

## Required Workflows

### 1. Main CI/CD Pipeline

**File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`**

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -e ".[dev]"
    
    - name: Run linting
      run: |
        ruff check src/ tests/
        black --check src/ tests/
        mypy src/
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest --cov=materials_orchestrator --cov-report=xml
    
    - name: Upload coverage
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      with:
        file: ./coverage.xml

  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: 3.11

      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install safety bandit[toml] semgrep
    
    - name: Run security checks
      run: |
        safety check --json --output safety-report.json || true
        bandit -r src/ -f json -o bandit-report.json || true
        semgrep --config=auto src/ --json --output=semgrep-report.json || true
    
    - name: Upload security reports
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: security-reports
        path: "*-report.json"

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [test, security]
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: 3.11
    
    - name: Build package
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip build
        python -m build
    
    - name: Upload artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: dist
        path: dist/
```

### 2. Security Scanning Workflow

**File: `.github/workflows/security.yml`**

```yaml
name: Security Scan

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2 AM
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  dependency-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: 3.11
    
    - name: Install pip-audit
      run: pip install pip-audit
    
    - name: Run dependency audit
      run: pip-audit --desc --format=json --output=dependency-audit.json
    
    - name: Create security issue
      if: failure()
      uses: actions/github-script@v6
      with:
        script: |
          github.rest.issues.create({
            owner: context.repo.owner,
            repo: context.repo.repo,
            title: 'Security vulnerabilities detected',
            body: 'Automated security scan found vulnerabilities. Check the workflow logs.',
            labels: ['security', 'automated']
          })

  codeql:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      security-events: write
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
      with:
        languages: python
    
    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
```

### 3. Performance Testing Workflow

**File: `.github/workflows/performance.yml`**

```yaml
name: Performance Tests

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 4 * * 1'  # Weekly on Monday at 4 AM

jobs:
  benchmark:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: 3.11
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -e ".[dev]"
        pip install pytest-benchmark memory-profiler
    
    - name: Run benchmarks
      run: |
        pytest benchmarks/ --benchmark-json=benchmark-results.json
    
    - name: Store benchmark results
      uses: benchmark-action/github-action-benchmark@v1
      with:
        tool: 'pytest'
        output-file-path: benchmark-results.json
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        auto-push: true
        comment-on-alert: true
        alert-threshold: '150%'
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create the workflow files** in `.github/workflows/` directory
2. **Configure branch protection rules** requiring CI checks to pass
3. **Set up CodeCov integration** for coverage reporting
4. **Configure Dependabot** for automated dependency updates
5. **Enable security advisories** in repository settings

## Security Considerations

- All workflows use pinned action versions
- Secrets are properly managed through GitHub Secrets
- Security reports are uploaded as artifacts for review
- Automated issue creation for security findings

## Performance Monitoring

- Benchmark results are tracked over time
- Performance regression alerts are configured
- Memory profiling included for resource-intensive operations

## Next Steps

After implementing these workflows:
1. Monitor initial runs and fix any issues
2. Configure notification settings for failures
3. Set up automated dependency updates
4. Implement deployment workflows for releases
