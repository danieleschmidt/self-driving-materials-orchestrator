# ADR-0000: Use Architecture Decision Records

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The self-driving-materials-orchestrator project involves complex architectural decisions that impact system design, performance, and maintainability. As the project grows and team members change, we need a way to:

1. Document the reasoning behind important architectural decisions
2. Provide context for future developers about why certain choices were made
3. Enable informed evolution of the architecture over time
4. Facilitate architectural reviews and discussions

Without proper documentation of architectural decisions, we risk:
- Repeating past discussions and debates
- Making decisions that conflict with previous choices
- Losing institutional knowledge when team members leave
- Difficulty onboarding new team members

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document architectural decisions for the self-driving-materials-orchestrator project.

ADRs will be:
- Stored in the `docs/adr/` directory in the repository
- Written in Markdown format
- Numbered sequentially (ADR-0000, ADR-0001, etc.)
- Follow the format: Status, Context, Decision, Consequences
- Version controlled alongside the codebase
- Required for any significant architectural changes

Significant architectural decisions include:
- Technology stack choices (languages, frameworks, databases)
- System architecture patterns and approaches
- Integration strategies with external systems
- Security and compliance approaches
- Performance and scalability strategies
- Data management and storage decisions

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear documentation of architectural decisions and their rationale
- Better onboarding experience for new team members
- More informed architectural evolution over time
- Reduced repetition of past architectural discussions
- Improved transparency in architectural decision-making
- Historical record of architectural changes and their motivations

### Negative
- Additional overhead to create and maintain ADRs
- Potential for ADRs to become outdated if not maintained
- Time investment required for thorough documentation
- Need to train team members on ADR process and format

### Neutral
- ADRs become part of the standard development workflow
- Architectural discussions must include ADR creation/updates
- Pull requests for architectural changes must include relevant ADRs

## Implementation Notes

1. Create `docs/adr/` directory structure
2. Establish ADR template and numbering convention
3. Train team members on ADR process
4. Include ADR creation in definition of done for architectural changes
5. Review and update ADRs during quarterly architecture reviews
