## 1. Introduction

The traditional Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for scientific computing applications, particularly in materials discovery, faces significant challenges including lengthy development cycles, manual quality assurance bottlenecks, and limited research integration. Recent advances in AI-driven automation present opportunities to revolutionize scientific software development through autonomous execution of entire development lifecycles.
