# Compliance and Security Framework

This document outlines the compliance and security measures implemented in the Self-Driving Materials Orchestrator.

## Security Standards

### SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts)

The project implements SLSA Level 2 compliance:

- ✅ **Source integrity**: All source code is version controlled in Git
- ✅ **Build service**: Builds are automated through CI/CD pipelines  
- ✅ **Provenance**: Build provenance is recorded and verifiable
- ✅ **Hermetic builds**: Builds are isolated and reproducible

### Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

- **Format**: CycloneDX 1.4
- **Location**: `SBOM.json`
- **Updates**: Automatically generated on each release
- **Contents**: All dependencies with licenses and versions

### Vulnerability Management

#### Dependency Scanning
- **Tool**: Safety + Bandit
- **Frequency**: Every commit via pre-commit hooks
- **Policy**: Block high severity (CVSS >= 7.0) vulnerabilities
- **Configuration**: `.safety-policy.json`

#### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- **Tool**: Bandit
- **Coverage**: All Python source code
- **Configuration**: `.bandit`
- **Exclusions**: Test files, build artifacts

#### Container Security
- **Base Images**: Official Python slim images only
- **Scanning**: Trivy for container vulnerabilities
- **Non-root**: Applications run as non-root user
- **Secrets**: No secrets in container images

## Compliance Frameworks
