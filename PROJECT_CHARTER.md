# Project Charter - Self-Driving Materials Orchestrator

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Self-Driving Materials Orchestrator  
**Project Code:** SDMO  
**Charter Date:** August 1, 2025  
**Charter Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

The Self-Driving Materials Orchestrator is an autonomous laboratory platform that accelerates materials discovery through intelligent experiment planning, robotic execution, and real-time analysis.

2. **Limited Exploration**: Human bias leads to exploration of only 5-10% of viable parameter spaces
3. **Slow Iteration Cycles**: Traditional materials research requires weeks to months per iteration
4. **Data Fragmentation**: Experimental data scattered across notebooks, spreadsheets, and instruments
5. **Resource Inefficiency**: Laboratory equipment utilization typically <30% due to manual coordination

### Quantified Impact
- **Time Waste**: 40+ hours/week on routine experimental tasks
- **Discovery Speed**: 6-18 months to validate single material composition
- **Success Rate**: <15% hit rate for target material properties
